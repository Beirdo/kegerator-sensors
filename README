The hardware design was completed using the geda toolset, and my test boards
are being made by batchpcb.com.  Almost all parts purchased from digikey.com.

I will add bill of materials, etc later as time allows.

The firmware for the sensors and receiver uses the gcc-avr and avr-libc
packages for building, and avrdude for programming (with a buspirate
programmer).

In ubuntu, you will need the following debs:

For firmware:
avr-libc
avrdude
avrdude-doc
binutils-avr
gcc-avr
gdb-avr
simulavr

For schematic/circuit board:
geda
geda-doc
geda-examples
geda-gattrib
geda-gnetlist
geda-gschem
geda-gsymcheck
geda-symbols
geda-utils
gerbv
pcb
pcb-common
pcb-gtk
zip
